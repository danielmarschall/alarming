# Alarming / Motion detection

A client/server application that, when certain events occur, such as movement on a webcam, opens a window with the webcam image for connected clients and stops playing music. Can be combined with the [Spotify Control Panel](https://www.daniel-marschall.de/spotify_control/).

The server runs on Linux and requires the "motion" program

The client is running on Windows.
